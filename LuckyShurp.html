                    Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for
                    plants.
                    Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of
                    landscapers.
                    Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.
